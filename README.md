## Summer Practice Continental
During the summer, period I have worked at ***Continetal's Summer Practice*** on the project **Deep Learning Based on CNN for Pedestrian Detection** in Python. We used used an open-source algorithm , **YOLO**, to train 2 models, ***yolov3*** and ***yolov5***, in order to compare the results.

That's why, in this repository there are image processing and classification exercises and codes to automate some processes for the project.
