The **aess dataset** is the dataset that we used for training the models. This dataset comes with images and a database containing the names of the images and annotations
for each (coordinates of boxes where pedestrians were located, in a Pascol VOC format). The scope of my program is to parse through the database and make for each image a
.txt file with YOLO format box coordinates.
